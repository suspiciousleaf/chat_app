# Chat Application Performance Improvement Design Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the strategy for improving the performance of a chat application server, focusing on three key areas.
<!-- : message serialization, CPU usage optimization, and authentication/history loading enhancements. -->

## 2. Current Performance Issues
- High CPU usage and increased latency when message volume increases
- Inefficient message serialization
- Heavy load from authentication processes
- Performance issues with channel message history loading

## 3. Performance Improvement Goals

### 3.1 Message Serialization Optimization
**Objective**: Reduce serialization overhead and improve message processing speed.

**Proposed Solution**: Implement orjson for efficient byte-based serialization.

**Action Items**:
- Replace current JSON serialization with orjson
- Benchmark performance before and after implementation
- Ensure compatibility with existing WebSocket transmission methods

**Expected Outcome**: Reduced CPU usage and lower latency in message processing, allowing higher message bandwidth.

### 3.2 CPU Usage Analysis and Optimization
**Objective**: Identify and address CPU bottlenecks in the application.

**Proposed Solution**: Utilize flame graphs for detailed CPU usage analysis.

**Action Items**:
- Set up profiling tools to generate flame graphs
- Analyze flame graphs to identify high-CPU operations
- Develop optimization strategies for identified bottlenecks
- Implement and test optimizations
- Re-profile to verify improvements

**Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive understanding of CPU usage patterns and targeted optimizations.

### 3.3 Authentication Load Reduction
**Objective**: Decrease authentication overhead.

**Proposed Solution**: 
Optimize authentication processes

**Action Items**:
- Analyze current authentication process for optimization opportunities
- Design and implement more efficient authentication method (e.g., caching, token-based auth, or other)

**Expected Outcome**: Reduced server load from authentication.

## 4. Implementation Timeline
